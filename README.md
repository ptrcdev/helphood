## Features

- **Real‑Time Requests:** Quickly submit and receive help requests with instant notifications to nearby volunteers.
- **User Roles:** Seamlessly distinguish between requesters (those who need help) and volunteers (those who want to help) during sign-up.
- **Authentication:** Secure, custom authentication using NextAuth.js with a credentials provider, integrated with MongoDB.
- **Responsive & Accessible UI:** A mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS ensures an intuitive experience for users of all ages, including seniors.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profiles, manage contact preferences, and set privacy options.
- **Progressive Onboarding:** A multi‑step sign-up process guides users through account creation and profile setup.
- **Extensibility:** Designed with future enhancements in mind, from advanced notifications to additional community features.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** [Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessible UI components.
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for data storage.
- **Real‑Time Notifications:** Socket.IO (or alternative services) to push real‑time events.
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, and Supertest ensure robust unit and integration tests.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for seamless CI/CD and production performance.

## Architecture

HelpHood follows a modular architecture:

- **Client Side:**  
  Uses Next.js with a clear separation of components (e.g., Cards, Forms, Select Inputs) and pages. Real‑time features are implemented via portals and event listeners for dynamic user interactions.
- **Server Side:**  
  API routes handle CRUD operations for help requests and user profiles, integrated with MongoDB. Authentication is managed via NextAuth.js, with JWT-based sessions that can be refreshed or updated upon profile changes.
- **Real‑Time Layer:**  
  Notifications are pushed instantly to volunteers via Socket.IO, ensuring that help is provided promptly.
